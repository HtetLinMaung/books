# Docker Security

In this chapter, we will discuss Docker security, including best practices, Docker security features, securing Docker containers, Docker container vulnerabilities, and Docker security tools.

## Docker security best practices

To ensure the security of your Docker environment, follow these best practices:

1. Keep Docker up to date: Regularly update your Docker installation to benefit from security fixes and enhancements.
2. Use minimal base images: Use minimal and trusted base images like Alpine Linux, which contains fewer packages and reduces the attack surface.
3. Scan images for vulnerabilities: Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools such as Clair, Anchore, or Snyk.
4. Use user namespaces: Use user namespaces to map container root users to a non-root user on the host system, reducing the impact of a container breakout.
5. Use Docker Secrets: Use Docker Secrets for storing sensitive information, such as credentials, securely.
6. Limit container resources: Use Docker's resource management features (CPU, memory, and I/O limits) to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

## Docker security features

Docker provides several built-in security features, including:

1. Namespaces: Docker uses Linux namespaces to isolate containers from each other and the host system. Each container runs in its own namespace, ensuring process and filesystem isolation.
2. Control groups (cgroups): Docker uses cgroups to manage and limit resource usage by containers.
3. Capabilities: Docker allows you to define the capabilities granted to a container, limiting its access to system resources and functionality.
4. Seccomp: Docker supports Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) profiles to restrict the system calls a container can make, reducing the attack surface.

## Securing Docker containers

To secure your Docker containers:

1. Limit container capabilities: Use the `--cap-drop` and `--cap-add` flags when starting containers to limit their capabilities and reduce the potential impact of container breakouts.
2. Use read-only file systems: Use the `--read-only` flag when starting containers to make their file systems read-only, preventing unauthorized file changes.
3. Drop unused network capabilities: Use the `--network` flag to specify the network mode for containers and disable unused network capabilities, reducing the attack surface.

## Docker container vulnerabilities

Containers can be vulnerable to several types of attacks, including:

1. Kernel exploits: Containers share the host's kernel, making them vulnerable to kernel exploits that could compromise the entire host system.
2. Container breakouts: An attacker who gains access to a container could attempt to escape the container and gain access to the host system or other containers.
3. Denial of service: Containers can be targeted by denial of service attacks, causing resource exhaustion and impacting the availability of services.

## Docker security tools

Several third-party tools can help you secure your Docker environment:

1. Clair: An open-source vulnerability scanner for Docker images.
2. Anchore: A platform for analyzing, inspecting, and certifying Docker images.
3. Snyk: A security tool that scans Docker images for vulnerabilities and provides remediation advice.

In conclusion, securing your Docker environment is essential to protect your applications and infrastructure. By following best practices, using Docker's built-in security features, and leveraging third-party tools, you can minimize the risk of attacks and ensure the safety of your containerized applications.

## Summing up

In this chapter, we examined Docker security, including best practices, built-in security features, securing Docker containers, container vulnerabilities, and security tools. To ensure a secure Docker environment, it's important to regularly update your Docker installation, use minimal base images, and scan for vulnerabilities. Employing Docker's native security features like namespaces, control groups, capabilities, and Seccomp profiles can help minimize risks. To further enhance security, leverage third-party tools like Clair, Anchore, and Snyk. By combining best practices, Docker's security features, and external tools, you can effectively protect your containerized applications and infrastructure from potential attacks.

## Knowledge Test

1. Set up a minimal base image for your Docker container using Alpine Linux. Create a Dockerfile with the following content, and then build and run the container:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]
```

Build the image with `docker build -t alpine-hello-world .` and run the container with `docker run alpine-hello-world`.

2. Use Clair to scan your Docker images for vulnerabilities. Set up a local instance of Clair and Clairctl, then scan the `alpine-hello-world` image you created in Exercise 1.

3. Create a Docker container that runs with limited capabilities. Use the `--cap-drop` and `--cap-add` flags to create a container that can only execute the ping command. Test the container's functionality and ensure it can only run the allowed command.

4. Secure a container by making its file system read-only. Create a new Docker container and use the `--read-only` flag to start it. Verify that you cannot write or modify files inside the container.

5. Configure a custom network for your Docker containers. Use the `--network` flag to create a new Docker container connected to a user-defined bridge network. Verify the network isolation by inspecting the container's network settings.

6. Research and test one of the Docker security tools mentioned in this chapter (Clair, Anchore, or Snyk). Set up the tool and use it to scan a Docker image for vulnerabilities. Document the steps and results of the scan.
